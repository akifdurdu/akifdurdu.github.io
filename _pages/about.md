I have been a Professor in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at Konya Technical University (KTUN) since 2013. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Selçuk University in 2001 and completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU) in 2012.

My research interests focus on intelligent transportation systems, unmanned autonomous systems, search and rescue robotics, sensor fusion, human-robot interaction, multi-robot networks, and sensor networks. I have been actively teaching courses in control engineering, robotics, and mechatronic systems since 2012, mentoring the next generation of engineers and researchers in these fields.

In 2014, I founded the Robotics Automation Control Research Laboratory (<a href="https://raclab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RACLAB</a>), which has become a dynamic research hub for undergraduate and graduate students. Within RACLAB, nearly 50 TÜBİTAK-funded student projects have been successfully completed, fostering hands-on innovation and research experience. The lab has actively participated in both national competitions such as TEKNOFEST and a variety of international competitions, reflecting our commitment to excellence and global collaboration.

Since 2020, I have been actively leading and consulting on industry-driven R&D projects with a total budget exceeding 10 million TL, supported under TÜBİTAK TEYDEB 1501, 1507, and KOSGEB programs. These projects aim to develop innovative solutions in industrial autonomous systems, intelligent control, and digital transformation, in close collaboration with sector-leading companies.

Throughout my academic career, I have published over 100 publications, which have collectively garnered more than 2250 citations on Google Scholar, reflecting the impact of my research. According to the Web of Science database, I have 66 publications with 911 citations, and my current H-Index stands at 16. I have successfully supervised 16 M.S. students and 8 Ph.D. students, many of whom have gone on to contribute significantly to industry and academia.

I also serve as a technological consultant for four companies working to advance industrial autonomous systems, providing expertise in integrating cutting-edge research with practical applications. My contributions to the field of intelligent systems have been recognized through collaborations and projects that bridge academia and industry.
